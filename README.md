Comprio is a Point of Sale solution as a service. The platform is targeted at small businesses that sell consumable goods, such as coffee shops and bakeries.  Through the intuitive interface managers are able to manage product offerings, employees, as well as view transactional analytics. Even small businesses will now be able to offer intuitive and effective rewards programs, incentivizing return visitors and increasing transaction volume. 

Customers will enjoy the benefits that come with having a single account for collecting points from all their favourite shops, and having transactional It includes things like stores and their locations, managers and employees, menus and products, as well as information about customers. Our service will be hosted online and each company can subscribe to it. Therefore, a company can register and assign employees and managers. A manager can then create employee accounts, create/edit menus, and perform other store related tasks.

There will be different classes of users: customers, cashiers, managers and system admins. The customers can register an account with a company and gain points for each purchase. The points can then be used to acquire products, each product having a point equivalent price. They can also track their purchases in a history view.

The company will be able to have a menu, where each menu is composed of multiple products. The products have a price, calorie count, and weight/volume.
